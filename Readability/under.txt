This is George Beard and Harold Hutchins. George is the kid on the left with
the tie and the flat top.  Harold is the one on the right with the T-shirt
and bad haircut.  Remember that now.

All of the experts at Jerome Horwitz Elementary School had their opinions
about George and Harold.  Their guidance counselor, Mr. Rected, thought the
boys suffered from ADD.  The school psychologist, Miss Labler, diagnosed
them with ADHD.  And their mean old principal, Mr. Krupp, thought they were
just plain old BAD.

But if you ask me, George and Harold simply suffered from IBSS (incredibly
boring school syndrome).

You see, George and Harold weren't really bad kids.  They were actually very
bright, good-natured boys.  Their only problem was that they were bored in
school. So they took it upon themselves to "liven things up" for everybody.
Wasn't that thoughtful of them?

Unfortunately, George and Harold's thoughtfulness got them into trouble
every now and then.  Sometimes it got them into a LOT of trouble.  And one
time it got them into so much trouble, it almost caused the entire planet
to be taken over by a ruthless, maniacal, mad scientist guy in a robot
suit.

But before I can tell you that story, I have to tell you this story.
